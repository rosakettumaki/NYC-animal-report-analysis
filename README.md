***Urban Wildlife Analysis: Raccoons in NYC***
This project analyzes animal condition response data from NYC Parks, with a focus on raccoons. Using Python and pandas, I explored trends in animal health, response times, and borough-level differences. 
The analysis found that raccoons are frequently reported across the city — especially in Manhattan — and many are found sick, injured, or dead. Most cases required intervention from animal control services. 
The data highlights how urban wildlife problems reflect deeper questions about coexistence and public infrastructure in dense city environments.
